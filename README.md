# dummySweep_pyQt5
Test GUI for JV sweeps, set up with a "dummy sweep" function to emulate a source meter, so that no hardware needs to be programmed while I learn pyQt5.



# Method types

enforcer[ClusterName]
e.g. enforcerSweepPropertyCluster

Watches to make sure values are sensible,  otherwise warns user. e.g. "Are you sure you want to run a 100 volt scan?" kind of thing.
